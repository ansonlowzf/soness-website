    description: `Don't expect it tastes like "Durian", the bee is harvesting the flower, not the fruit. It tastes sweet and smells 30% like wild honey & 70% flower honey (taste & smell is opinionated). The moisture level is high due to the forest environment. If the stock is running out, then we need to wait for the next "Durian" season. During this time, the bee farmer will move the hive to harvest another flower. Honey is filtered and packed in food grade bottles.`,
