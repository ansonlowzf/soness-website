    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Health care drinker to honey wholeseller</p>
    <p>We were buying honey in the supermarket few years ago</p>
    <p>Relative said we should buy from pasar pagi for pure honey and we did</p>
    <p>
      Some friend said we should try orang asli's raw honey, we bought some
      beside the highway
    </p>
    <p>
      Another friend said we should buy from famous local brand for real honey
    </p>
    <p>Government said 80% of honey selling in the market was not pure</p>
    <p>
      What the...? we just want to drink for health care, Why it's so
      complicated?
    </p>
    <p>Until, we met a bee farmer, we learned what is surcose, frustose</p>
    <p>
      We decide to make the real raw and pure honey easy accessable in the
      market
